            Hi, I am Lei Wang, a master student in Australia National University. My major is Computer Science and specialised in Artificial Intelligence. However, when I was a undergraduate student, I majored in Electronic Engineering. The reason why I change major is that I want to know the anwers when I find the intelligent machine coule be so smart to understand human language, or even to recognize human face. Now, I really appreciate my choice. Even it is hard at the beginning, at least I know how an intelligent machine analysis human language, rocogize human face, and play sudo game. In this website, I will breifly introduce my favorite projects have done before, and also attach my resume. 
<br>
<br>
What is not be ignored is my interests! I love <em>snow skiing and photograph.</em> In my undergraduate university there is a snow-skiing student union. I make a lot of amazing new friends there. We even represent our university to attend University student snow skiing competion and are awarded seilver prize. That I love Photograph and develop it into a habit is influenced by my father, who reveal, I think, the secrets about how to describe the world via images. I want share with you some photos about my interests here, since these photos are all with colorful stories.
